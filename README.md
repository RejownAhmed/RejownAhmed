- 👋 Hi, I’m @RejownAhmed
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and always learning new things. I just love to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript as my major. Before I learnt object oriented PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack web development
- 📫 You can easily contact me through an Email. And my mail address is rejownahmed@yahoo.com

🦾I have some extra skills. I am a certified graphics designer too. But since my passion is to code, 
   currently I'm not into it. However, sometimes I pass my time designing logos, maybe a business card or banners either for me or clients.
